          Building the circuit requires the knowledge of various components like
          resistors, inductors, capacitors, battery sources, connecting wires
          and more. The resistor is one of the main components of the circuit.
          In this session, let us know in detail about the resistor.{" "}

            <p>
              A passive electrical component with two terminals that are used
              for either limiting or regulating the flow of electric current in
              electrical circuits.

            The main purpose of resistor is to reduce the current flow and to
            lower the voltage in any particular portion of the circuit. It is
            made of copper wires which are coiled around a ceramic rod and the
            outer part of the resistor is coated with an insulating paint.

                The terminals of the resistor are each of the lines extending
                from the squiggle (or rectangle). Those are what connect to the
                rest of the circuit. The resistor circuit symbols are usually
                enhanced with both a resistance value and a name. The value,
                displayed in ohms, is obviously critical for both evaluating and
                actually constructing the circuit.

                  Resistors are available in different shapes and sizes. Common
                  types that are available are through-hole and surface mount. A
                  resistor might be static, standard resistor, special, or a
                  pack of variable resistors.
