          <strong>Inductors,</strong> much like conductors and resistors, are simple
          components that are used in electronic devices to carry out specific
          functions. Normally, inductors are coil-like structures that are found in
          electronic circuits. The coil is an insulated wire that is looped around the
          central core.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inductors are mostly used to decrease or control the electric spikes by
          storing energy temporarily in an electromagnetic field, and then releasing
          it back into the circuit.
        </p>
        <h2>What Is an Inductor?</h2>
        <p>
          An inductor is a passive component that is used in most power electronic
          circuits to store energy in the form of magnetic energy when electricity is
          applied to it. One of the key properties of an inductor is that it impedes
          or opposes any change in the amount of current flowing through it. Whenever
          the current across the inductor changes, it either acquires charge or loses
          the charge in order to equalise the current passing through it. The inductor
          is also called a choke, a reactor or just a coil.

        <p>
          An inductor is described by its distinctive nature of inductance, which is
          defined as the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current.
          Inductance is a result of the induced magnetic field on the coil. It is also
          determined by several factors, such as
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The shape of the coil.</li>
          <li>The number of turns and layers of the wire.</li>
          <li>The space that is given between the turns.</li>
          <li>Permeability of the core material.</li>
          <li>The size of the core.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The SI unit of inductance is henry (H), and when we measure magnetic
          circuits, it is equivalent to weber/ampere. It is denoted by the symbol L.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, an inductor is totally different from a capacitor. In the case of
          a capacitor, it stores energy as electrical energy, but as mentioned above,
          an inductor stores energy in the form of magnetic energy. One key feature of
          the inductor is that it also changes its polarity while discharging. In this
          way, polarity during discharging can be made opposite to the polarity during
          charging. The polarity of the induced voltage is well explained by{" "}

        </h2>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            If we look at the construction of an inductor, it usually consists of a
            coil of conducting material (widely used ones include insulated copper
            wire) that is wrapped around a core that is made up of plastic material or
            ferromagnetic material. One advantage of using a ferromagnetic core is
            that it has high permeability, which helps in increasing the magnetic
            field and, at the same time, confining it closely to the inductor.
            Ultimately this results in higher inductance.&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            On the other hand, inductors with low frequency are usually constructed
            like transformers. They have cores made up of electrical steel that is
            laminated to help prevent eddy currents. ‘Soft’ ferrites are also widely
            used for cores above audio frequencies.&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            Inductors come in many shapes and types. In some inductors, you will find
            an adjustable core that allows changing the inductance. Inductors that are
            used in blocking very high frequencies are mostly made by stringing a
            ferrite bead on a wire.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            Planar inductors are made using a planar core, while small-value inductors
            are built on integrated circuits using the processes of making
            interconnects. Typically, an aluminium interconnect is used and fixed in a
            spiral coil pattern. However, small dimensions have some limitations. They
            restrict the inductance.&nbsp;
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            There are also shielded inductors which are commonly used in power
            regulation systems, lighting, and other systems requiring low-noise
            operating conditions. These inductors are often partially or fully
            shielded.
          </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Different Types of Inductors</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the type of material used, inductors can be classified as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Iron Core Inductor</li>
          <li>Air Core Inductor</li>
          <li>Iron Powder Inductor</li>
          <li>Ferrite Core Inductor, which is divided into:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Soft Ferrite</li>
          <li>Hard Ferrite</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Iron Core Inductor</h3>
        <p>
          As the name suggests, the core of this type of inductor is made of iron.
          These inductors are low-space inductors that have high power and high
          inductance value. However, they are limited in high-frequency capacity.
          These inductors are used in audio equipment.
        </p>
        <h3>Air Core Inductor</h3>
        <p>
          These inductors are used when the amount of inductance required is low.
          Since there is no core, it does not have a core loss. But the number of
          turns the inductor must have is more for this type when compared to the
          inductors with the core. This results in a high-quality factor. Usually,
          ceramic inductors are often referred to as air-core inductors.

        </p>
        <h3>Iron Powder Inductor</h3>
        <p>
          In this type of inductor, the core is iron oxide. They are formed by very
          fine and insulating particles of pure iron powder. High magnetic flux can be
          stored in it due to the air gap. The permeability of the core of this type
          of inductor is very less and is usually below 100. They are mainly used in
          switching power supplies.
        </p>
        <h3>Ferrite Core Inductor</h3>
        <p>
          In this type of inductor, ferrite materials are used as the core. The
          general composition of ferrites is XFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4,</sub> where X
          represents transition material. Ferrites can be classified into two types:
          soft ferrites and hard ferrites.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Soft Ferrite: These are materials that have the ability to reverse their
            polarity without any external energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hard Ferrite: These are permanent magnets, that is, their polarity will
            not change even when the magnetic field is removed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <strong>Choke</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            A choke is a type of inductor that is used mainly for blocking
            high-frequency alternating current (AC) in an electrical circuit. On the
            other hand, it will allow DC or low-frequency signals to pass. As the
            function of this inductor is to restrict the changes in current, it is
            called a choke. This inductor consists of a coil of insulated wire wound
            on a magnetic core. The main difference between chokes and other inductors
            is that they do not require high Q factor construction techniques, which
            aim to reduce the resistance in inductors found in tuned circuits.
          </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Functions of an Inductor</h2>
        <p>Inductors can be used for two primary functions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>To control signals.</li>
          <li>To store energy.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Controlling Signals</h3>
        <p>
          Coils in an inductor can be used to store energy. The function of the
          inductor depends upon the frequency of the current passing through it. That
          is, higher frequency signals will be passed less easily and vice versa. This
          function tells that it blocks AC Current and passes DC Current. Hence, it
          can be used to block AC signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inductors can be used along with{" "}
          <a href="https://byjus.com/jee/capacitor-types-and-capacitance/">
            capacitors
          </a>{" "}
          to form LC filters.
        </p>
        <h3>Storing Energy</h3>
        <p>
          Inductor stores energy in the form of magnetic energy. Coils can store
          electrical energy in the form of magnetic energy, using the property that an
          electric current flowing through a coil produces a magnetic field, which in
          turn, produces an electric current. In other words, coils offer a means of
          storing energy on the basis of inductivity.
        </p>
        <h2>Inductors in Parallel Form</h2>
        <p>
          If two terminals of an inductor are connected to two terminals of another
          inductor, then the inductors are said to be parallel. We know that when
          resistors are connected in parallel, their effective resistance decreases.
          Similarly, when inductors are connected in parallel form, their effective
          inductance decreases. Inductors in parallel are somewhat similar to the
          capacitors in series.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the example below:</p>
        <p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Here, the current flowing through each inductor will be different. This
          current depends upon the inductance value. However, the voltage across each
          conductor will be the same. By using Kirchoff’s Current law, the total
          current is the sum of the current through each branch. That is,
        </p>
        <p>
          I<sub>T</sub> = I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> +I<sub>3</sub>
        </p>
        <p>We know that the voltage across an inductor is given by the equation</p>
        <p>V = L di / dt</p>
        <p>We can write,</p>
        <p>
          v<sub>AB</sub> = L<sub>Total</sub> x dl<sub>t</sub> / dt
        </p>
        <p>
          V<sub>AB</sub> = L<sub>Total</sub> x d (I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + I
          <sub>3</sub>) / dt
        </p>
        <p>We can further write it as</p>
        <p>
          v<sub>AB</sub> = L<sub>Total</sub> x dl<sub>1</sub> / dt + L<sub>Total</sub>{" "}
          x dl<sub>2</sub> / dt + L<sub>Total</sub> x dl<sub>3</sub> / dt
        </p>
        <p>That is,</p>
        <p>
          v<sub>AB</sub> = L<sub>Total</sub> ( V / L<sub>1</sub> + V / L<sub>2</sub> +
          V / L<sub>3</sub> )
        </p>
        <p>Since voltage are equal, we can simplify the equation as,</p>
        <p>
          1 / L<sub>Total</sub> = 1 / L<sub>1</sub> + 1 / L<sub>2</sub> + 1 / L
          <sub>3</sub>
        </p>
        <h2>Inductors in Series</h2>
        <p>
          When the inductors are chained together in a straight line or when they are
          connected end to end, then the inductors are said to be in a series
          connection. We know that when resistors are connected in series, their
          effective resistance increases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, when inductors are connected in series, their effective
          inductance increases. Inductors in series are somewhat similar to the
          capacitors in parallel. In order to get the total inductance, it is very
          easy. You only have to add every inductance. That is, when inductors are
          connected in series, the total inductance is the sum of all inductance.
        </p>
        <p>Consider the connection below:</p>
        <p>
          <img

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Here, three inductors are connected in series. In this case, the current
          flowing through each inductor is the same, while the voltage across each
          inductor is different. This voltage depends upon the inductance value. By
          using{" "}
          <a href="https://byjus.com/physics/kirchhoffs-law/">
            Kirchoff’s voltage law
          </a>
          , the total voltage drop is the sum of the voltage drop across each
          inductor. That is,
        </p>
        <p>
          V<sub>T</sub> = V<sub>1</sub> + V<sub>2</sub> +V<sub>3</sub>
        </p>
        <p>We know that the voltage across an inductor is given by the equation</p>
        <p>V = L di / dt</p>
        <p>So, here we can write,</p>
        <p>
          L<sub>Total</sub> dl / dt = L<sub>1</sub> x dl<sub>1</sub> / dt + L
          <sub>2</sub> x dl<sub>2</sub> / dt + L<sub>3</sub> x dl<sub>3</sub> / dt
        </p>
        <p>But</p>
        <p>
          I = I<sub>1</sub> = I<sub>2</sub> = I<sub>3</sub>
        </p>
        <p>Therefore,</p>
        <p>
          L dl / dt = L<sub>1</sub> x dl / dt + L<sub>2</sub> x dl / dt + L
          <sub>3</sub> x dl / dt
        </p>
        <p>
          L<sub>Total</sub> = L<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub> + L<sub>3</sub>
        </p>
        <h2>Energy Stored in an Inductor</h2>
        <p>
          When a current passes through an inductor, an emf is induced in it. This
          back emf opposes the flow of current through the inductor. So, in order to
          establish a current in the inductor, work has to be done against this emf by
          the voltage source.
        </p>
        <p>Consider a time interval dt.</p>
        <p>During this period, work done, dW, is given by</p>
        <p>dW = Pdt = – Eidt = iL di / dt x dt = Lidi</p>
        <p>To find the total work done, the above expression must be integrated.</p>
        <p>
          W = <sub>0</sub>∫<sup>I</sup>Lidi = ½ LI<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, energy stored in an inductor is given by the equation,</p>
        <p>
          W = ½ LI<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <h2>Impedance of an Inductor</h2>
        <p>
          AC resistance mostly determines the opposition of current flowing through a
          coil. This AC resistance is most commonly known as impedance. In this
          section, since we are discussing the opposition given by the inductor, this
          can be called inductive reactance. Inductive reactance, which is given the
          symbol X<sub>L, </sub>is the property in an AC circuit that opposes the
          change in the current.
        </p>
        <p>It is given by the equation,</p>
        <p>
          X<sub>L</sub> = V<sub>L</sub> / I<sub>L</sub> = Lω
        </p>
        <p>
          From the equation, it is clear that inductive reactance is proportional to
          frequency.
        </p>
        <p>The plot of frequency vs reactance is given below:</p>

                        The phenomenon in which an emf is induced in a coil due to the
                        change of current through the coil itself is known as
                        self-induction.
