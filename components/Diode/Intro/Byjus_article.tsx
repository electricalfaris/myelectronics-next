            A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts
            electricity primarily in one direction. It has high resistance on
            one end and low resistance on the other end. In this article, let us
            understand in detail about what is diode and diode symbol.

              like silicon and germanium are used to make the most of the
              diodes. Even though they transmit current in a single direction,
              the way with which they transmit differs. There are different

                A standard diode symbol is represented as above. In the above
                diagram, we can see that there are two terminals that are known
                as anode and cathode. The arrowhead is the anode that represents
                the direction of the conventional current flow in the forward
                biased condition. The other end is the cathode.

                Diodes can be made of either of the two semiconductor materials,
                silicon and germanium. When the anode voltage is more positive
                than the cathode voltage, the diode is said to be
                forward-biased, and it conducts readily with a relatively
                low-voltage drop. Likewise, when the cathode voltage is more
                positive than the anode, the diode is said to be reverse-biased.
                The arrow in the diode symbol represents the direction of
                conventional current flow when the diode conducts.

                  When an electric current between the electrodes passes through
                  this diode, light is produced. In other words, light is
                  generated when a sufficient amount of forwarding current
                  passes through it. In many diodes, this light generated is not
                  visible as there are frequency levels that do not allow
                  visibility. LEDs are available in different colours. There are
                  tricolour LEDs that can emit three colours at a time. Light
                  colour depends on the energy gap of the semiconductor used.

                  are costly when compared to LEDs and are cheaper when compared
                  to other laser generators. Limited life is the only drawback

                  It is the most useful type of diode as it can provide a stable
                  reference voltage. These are operated in reverse bias and
                  break down on the arrival of a certain voltage. If current
                  passing through the resistor is limited, a stable voltage is
                  generated. Zener diodes are widely used in power supplies to
                  provide a reference voltage.

                  It has a lower forward voltage than other silicon PN junction

                  at that stage, voltage ranges between 0.15 and 0.4 volts.
                  These are constructed differently in order to obtain that
                  performance. Schottky diodes are highly used in rectifier
